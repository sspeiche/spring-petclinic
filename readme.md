# Spring Pet Clinic and OpenShift

This repo contains a container-ready implementation of the iconic Spring Petclinic application. Specifically, this code is useful with the OpenShift Source-to-Image (s2i) technology.

There are three implementations available:
1. Localhost, using the docker runtime and the local machine  
1. OpenShift, using an OpenShift cluster
1. CodeReady Workspaces: start a workspace on Developer Sandbox for OpenShift [![Contribute](factory-contribute.svg)](https://codeready-codeready-workspaces-operator.apps.sandbox.x8i5.p1.openshiftapps.com/dashboard/#/load-factory/?url=https://github.com/sspeiche/spring-petclinic&policies.create=peruser) 
## Localhost Implementation

### Prerequisite

Download or clone this repo to your local machine and move into the resulting directory.

```
mvn package

docker-compose up

java -Dspring.profiles.active=mysql -jar target/spring-petclinic-2.3.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT.jar 

docker exec -it spring-petclinic_mysql_1 mysql -upetclinic -ppetclinic

show databases;
use petclinic;
show tables;

```

The GUI results with "Burr" as an owner when connected to MySQL

## OpenShift Implementation
*Note: You can get free access to Developer Sandbox for Red Hat OpenShift to implement this project. Simply browse to the following web page to get started: https://developers.redhat.com/sandbox-java-deployment*

Create a new OpenShift `Project` with `spring-petclinic` name.

### Note:
<hr>  
This step is optional and is not available when using the Developer Sandbox for Red Hat OpenShift. It will not affect the outcome of this project.  

The advantage of creating a separate project is that it is easier to tear down later. You simply delete the project. Otherwise, removing this project requires you to delete a Deployment, secrets, and other objects.
<hr>

### Dev Console

Then move to Developer perspective:

![Dev Perspective](images/3-switch-perspective.png)

And create a new MySQL instance by clicking the `+Add` button and choosing the `Database` option:

![Add DB](images/4-db.png)

Choose MySQL Ephemeral:

![MySQL Ephemeral](images/5-mysql-ephemeral.png)

and Click `Instantiate Template`.

Then fill the wizard with the following parameters:

![MySQL Template](images/6-db-params.png)

Click the `Create` button. 

We are using the **Ephemeral** implementation because this a short-lived demo and we do not need to retain the data.  

In a production system, you will most likely be using a permanent MySQL instance. This stores the data in a Persistent Volume (basically a virtual hard drive), meaning the MySQL pod can be destroyed and replaced with the data remaining intact.

### Deploy Pet Clinic App


Click the `+Add` button and choose `From Git` type:

Fill the git repo with the following value `https://github.com/redhat-developer-demos/spring-petclinic` and select the project as Java project:

![Pet Clinic Deploy](images/7-petclinic-deploy.png)

Click the `Build Configuration` link:

![Build Configuration](images/8-build-config.png)

Add the following environment variables:

```
SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=mysql
MYSQL_URL=jdbc:mysql://mysql:3306/petclinic
```

![DC Env Vars](images/9-app-env-vars.png)

Finally click the `Create` button and wait until the Build is done and the Pod is up and running (dark blue around the deployment bubble). In testing this using the Developer Sandbox for Red Hat OpenShift, this step took approximately six minutes. Please note: You *may* see error messages in the Sandbox. They are temporary while the application builds.  

Then push the Open URL button to view the Pet Clinic app:

![Pet Clinic Deployment](images/10-petclinic-url.png)


![Pet Clinic UI](images/11-output-ui.png)

And if you visit the MySQL deployment's Terminal then you connect to the database to see the schema and data


```
mysql -u root -h mysql -p

petclinic

use petclinic;
show tables;
```

```
select * from owners;
```
